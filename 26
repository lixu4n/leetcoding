26. Removing duplicates from sorted array
17/17/2024

Intuition

My initial intuition for this problem was to use nested loops and two pointers but was not necessary in the end since it is aa sorted array 


Complexity
- Time complexity:

O(n), where n is length of list.

1 â€”> for loop iteration is O(n)
